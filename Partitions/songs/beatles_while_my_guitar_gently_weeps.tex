\begin{guitar}
[A-] ~ [A-/G] ~ [F#-7b5] ~ [Fmaj7]
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
[A-] ~ [G] ~ [D] ~ [E]
While my guitar gently weeps
[A-] ~ [A-/G] ~ [F#-7b5] ~ [Fmaj7]
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
[A-] ~ [G] ~ [C] ~ [E]
Still my guitar gently weeps

[A] ~ [C#-] ~ [F#-] ~ [C#-] ~ [B-] ~ [B-] ~ [E] ~ [E]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you.

I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping

While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all?
Still my guitar gently weeps.
