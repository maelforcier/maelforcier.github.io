 If I forget you, will you remember me?
Do we even stand a chance, baby?
If I could break through, would it lead back to you?
Take a walk now in my shoes


It don't matter how many miles between us, ain't no hate could ever reach us
Yes, no, no, never
It don't matter how many miles between us, we know love like this could teach us
Yes, yours forever

One day, when we're all grown up
I'll be coming back for you
I'll be coming back for you, oh oh oh oh

One day, when we're all grown up
I'll be coming back for you
I'll be coming back for you, oh oh oh oh

Coming back for you
Coming back for you, oh oh oh oh


One day, when we're all grown up
I'll be coming back for you
I'll be coming back for you, oh oh oh oh

I hope that the years, they treat you kind
Hope you get what you deserve
I wish I could take you
I wish I could make you mine
But I know it ain't the time

It don't matter how many miles between us, ain't no hate could ever reach us
Yes, no, no, never
It don't matter how many miles between us, we know love like this could teach us
Yes, yours forever


One day, when we're all grown up
I'll be coming back for you
I'll be coming back for you, oh oh oh oh

One day, when we're all grown up
I'll be coming back for you
I'll be coming back for you, oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh

One day, when we're all grown up
I'll be coming back for you
I'll be coming back for you, oh oh oh oh

One day, when we're all grown up
I'll be coming back for you
I'll be coming back for you, oh oh oh oh
