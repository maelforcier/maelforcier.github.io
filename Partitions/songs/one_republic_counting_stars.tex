Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars

Yeah, we'll be counting stars

I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told


I feel something so, but right doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong, but doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars


I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Oh, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars

We'll be, counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be, counting stars

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt


Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt

Everything that kills me makes feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars


Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be, counting stars
