[A-]I can see you in the morning when you [E-]go to school
[G]Don't forget your books, you know you've got to learn the [D-]golden rule,
The [A-]teacher tells you stop your playin' get on with your work
And [G]be like Johnnie - "too-good", don't you know he [F]never shirks
- he's coming along! [A-] ~ [D] ~ [A-] ~ [G] ~ [A-] ~ [D] ~ [A-] ~ [G]

[A-] ~ [E-] ~ [G] ~ [D-]
After school is over you're playing in the park
Don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about
And grow up just like them - won't let you work it out
- and you're [C]full of [A-]doubt

[E]Don't do this and [A-]don't do that
[A-]What are they trying to do? [D-]Make a good boy of you
[C]Do they know [D-]where it's [E]at?
[E]Don't criticize, they're [A-]old and wise
Do as they tell you to
[D-]Don't want the devil to
[C]Come and [D-]put out your[E] eyes [A]

Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right
But while I am still living, I've just got this to say
It's always up to you if you want to be that
[F]want to see that
want to [C]see it that [E]way
- you're coming a[A-]long!
