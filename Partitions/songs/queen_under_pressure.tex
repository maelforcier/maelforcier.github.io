[D] ~ [A] ~ [G] ~ [A]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two

Puts people on streets
Bah bah bah bah bah bah
Bah bah bah bah bah bah
That's o-kay!

[G] ~ [A]
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out!
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
[D]Pressure on people
[A]
People on streets

Do do do bah bah bah bah
O-kay
Chippin' around
Kick my brains round the floor
These are the days
It never rains but it pours
People on streets
People on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out!
Pray tomorrow takes me higher higher higher
Pressure on people
People on streets

[G] ~ [C] ~ [G ~ [C]
Turned away from it all
Like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
[G] ~ [A]
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
[C]Why [F] why[G]  [F]why?
[A]
Love love love love
[A]
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking

Can't we [D]give ourselves [G]one more [A]chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we [D]give love [A]give love [D]give love?[A]
Give love give love give love give love give love?

Cause [G]love's such an [A]old fashioned [D]word
And love [A]dares you to [G]care
For the [A]people on the [D]edge of the [A]night
And love [G]dares you to [A]change our way
Of [D]caring a[A]bout ourselves
[G]This is our [A]last dance
[G]This is our [A]last dance
[D]This [G]is our[A]selves under pressure
Under pressure pressure
