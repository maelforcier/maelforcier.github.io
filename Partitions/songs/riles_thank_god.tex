Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive..
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive..

There will be highs, and lows.. thank God I remain ok
How can I prove them how hourglasses drive me insane
And I'm amazed, when I think about how lucky I am
Not to wake up in a country full of bombings
Killings, 'side of them I got no fucking problems
Glad you never tried to put me down
Oh too many times I did you wrong
Diggin' in my inner me
Then I found the enemies
How the fuck them niggas were too strong
And I kept those diamonds in my mind too long
No, they don't believe me 'cause I look too young
Keen everytime I see the beauty, bitter taste coming too quickly 'cause
I'm always looking for what's wrong

Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all

Yes I will survive..
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive..
Survive.. survive..
Survive..

Thank God I was dead, I came back three years ago
Body in the air, like they say it in these shows
You put me back in it, just to teach them what I know
Then I'll have to go

I gotta go, and see, all the shit that was in my mind
Thank God I do not live where Trump came after Obama
All my strength for the mamacitas
My brothers, sisters, never give up
Beginning of a new world that nobody wants
Believe it or not I still do trust in us now
Yeah I know, I know, I know
Rose got thorns and I got a long way to go
Plus i told ya, ya ya ya
No matter what happens we're never down, down, down

Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive..
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright

Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive..
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive.
