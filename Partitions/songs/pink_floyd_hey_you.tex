Intro
[MPIMIPMI] ~ [E-II] ~ [MPIAMIAI] ~ [D-II]

[E-]
Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you [B-]feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
[D]Hey you, donâ€™t help them to [D7]bury the [G]li-[D]i-[C]ight
[B-] Don't give in [A-] without a [E-]fight[D-].

Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with you ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home.


[C] But it was [D]only [G]fan[D]ta[C]sy.
The wall was too high,
As you can see.
No matter how he tried,
He could not break free.
[D7]And the worms ate into his [E-]brain.

Hey you, out there on the road
always doing what you're told,
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall,
Breaking bottles in the hall,
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all

Together we stand, divided we fall.
