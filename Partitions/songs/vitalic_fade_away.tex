\begin{guitar}
[Eb] ~ [Bb] ~ [C-] ~ [G#]
When you’re all over me, I drown
I had over beating
Blue, but your shine it seems the sound
That’s the sound that I once knew
In your ocean of the blue
Mirror skies that knew
When the sun had gone
As we find our flow and the night is over
You fade away, you fade away, you fade away
You fade away, you fade away, you fade away
The passing night, before the morning
My broken heart can’t mend
You fade away, you fade away, you fade away
You fade away, you fade away, you fade away
The passing night, before the morning
My broken heart can’t mend
When you’re all over me, I drown
I had over beating
Blue, but your shine it seems the sound
That’s the sound that I once knew
You fade away, you fade away, you fade away
You fade away, you fade away, you fade away
The passing night, before the morning
My broken heart can’t mend
