\begin{guitar}

[D-]I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a po[C]tential threat
[D-] And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my [C]only vice


But [D-]now it isn't true
Now [A7/C#]everything is new
And [D-]all I've learned has [A7-9/E]overturned
I [D-/F]beg of [G]you

[D-]Don't  [A/D]go w[D-]as--[A/D]ting [D-]your [Dsus4]e-----[Bb]mo---[A]tion
[D-]Lay [C/E]all -[F]your [Bb6]love [C7]on [F]me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
