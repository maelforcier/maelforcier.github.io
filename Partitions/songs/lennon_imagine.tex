C] ~ [Cmaj7]  ~ [F]  ~  % if chords overlap, add | at the end of the chord, like:

[C]Imagine there's [Cmaj7|]{no} [F]heaven
[C]It's easy if [Cmaj7|]{you} [F]try
[C]No hell [Cmaj7|]{below} [F]us
[C]Above us [Cmaj7|]{only} [F]sky


Imagine all the people
Living for today...

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace...

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
