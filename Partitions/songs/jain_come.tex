 Black burn. I feel so alone without you boy
Now I'm here hanging out in the street
Thinking about reactions over actions
Walking on the sky of my dreams


Come, come, my baby come
I will show you the world
Come ,come, my baby come
I will cover your nightmares
Come, come, my baby come
I will love you forever
Come, come, my baby come
I will not let you go

My love, I just feel so lost without you boy
I am yours even if time has passed
Take me away from this impetuous world
Leaving this jail of my mind

Come, come, my baby come
I will show you the world
Come ,come, my baby come
I will cover your nightmares

Come, come, my baby come
I will love you forever
Come, come, my baby come
I will not let you go

My soul, my soul is in Africa, with you boy

Come, come, my baby come
I will show you the world
Come ,come, my baby come
I will cover your nightmares
Come, come, my baby come
I will love you forever
Come, come, my baby come
I will not let you go

My soul, is in Africa with you boy
Looking at the stars on this diamond sky

Giving you my smile so you can keep it on your mind
Floating on your blazing eyes

Come, come, my baby come
I will show you the world
Come ,come, my baby come
I will cover your nightmares
Come, come, my baby come
I will love you forever
Come, come, my baby come
I will not let you go
