Intro
$|D-|F|G|D-|$

$|D-|C G |A-|$
 oh lord, hear me please
you have to make me sober
$|D-|C G |E-|$
aspirin, come on please
I don't want to suffer


I found one of my socks
under the telephone
I've never asked these bells
to ring in my home
what have I done to my hat?
I had no hat before
something like a tearing's running on my bones

[C] ~ [D] ~ [E-]
It's allright now
but what an awful night
I'm almost reaching the kitchen
I'll drink water till I die (about yesterday)

yesterday was the time of lavishness
everything 'round me was only loveliness
I was the king but the night was reigning over me
so much excitement but now this pleasure's gone without me


It's allright now
but what an awful night
I'm almost reaching the kitchen
I'll drink water till I die
I'll drink water till I die
I'll drink water till I die

aspirin, come on please
I don't want to suffer
oh lord, hear me please
you have to make me sober
but I don't know what's going on there
