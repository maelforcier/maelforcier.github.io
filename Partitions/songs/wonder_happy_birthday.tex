[C] ~ [Bb] ~ [A-] ~ [G] [F]

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
?Cause we all know in our minds

That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you

[F] ~ [G] ~ [F] ~ [G] ~

And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

[C]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

I just never understood
How a man who died for good

Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
that they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
