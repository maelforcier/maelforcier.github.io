 Just another one champion sound
me and Estelle about to get down
who the hottest in the world right now
Just touched down in London town
Bet they give me a pound

Tell them put the money in my hand right now
Tell the promoter we need more seats,
we just sold out all the floor seats

(Estelle)
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American Boy

He said Hey Sister
It's really really nice to meet ya
I just met this 5 foot 7 guys who's just my type
I like the way he's speaking his confidence is peaking
Don't like his baggy jeans but Ima like what's underneath them
And no I aint been to MIA

I heard that Cali never rains and New York heart awaits. First let's see the west end
I'll show you to my bedroom
I'm liking this American Boy
American Boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American Boy, American Boy

Can we get away this weekend
Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping baby then we'll go to a Caf√©
Let's go on the subway
Take me to your hood
I neva been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good

Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneaker's looking Fresh to Death I'm lovin those Shell Toes
Walkin that walk
Talk that slick talk
I'm likin this American Boy
American Boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American Boy

(Kanye West:)
Who killin em in the UK
Everybody gonna say you K,
reluctantly, because most of this press don't f**k wit me

Estelle once said to me, cool down down
don't act a fool now now
I always act a fool oww oww
Aint nothing new now now
He crazy, I know what ya thinkin
Ribena I know what you're drinkin
Rap singer. Chain Blinger. Holla at the next chick soon as you're blinkin
What's you're persona
About this Americana?
Am I shallow cuz all my clothes designer
Dressed smart like a London Bloke
Before he speak his suit bespoke
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this P Coat, Tell me he's broke
And I know you're not into all that. I heard your lyrics I feel your spirit
But I still talk that CAAASH

Cuz a lot WAGs want to hear it
And I'm feelin like Mike at his Baddest
The Pimps at their Gladist
And I know they love it
so to hell with all that rubbish

(Estelle:)
Would you be my love, my love
could be mine would you be my love my love, could be mine
Could you be my love, my love
Would you be my American Boy
American Boy

Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American Boy, American Boy
