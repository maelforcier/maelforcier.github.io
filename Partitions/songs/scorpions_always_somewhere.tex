\begin{guitar}


[C] Arrive at [G]seven, [F]the place [E]feels [A-]good
[C]No time to [G]call you to[A-]day
Encores till eleven then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again

I call your number the line ain't free
I like to tell you come to me
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love, I can't tell you how I feel

[C]Always [G]somewhere [A-]miss you where I've [A-/G]been
[F]I'll be [G]back to love you [C]again [G]

Always somewhere miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again

Another morning, another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again

Always somewhere miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
Always somewhere miss you where I've been
I'll be back to love you again
