[PIMI PIMI] ~
[E-II BI E-II BI E-II CI GIV BI] ~
[E- B E- B E- C G B]
	 Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like a birth squeeze
The love for what you hide
The bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born
When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Hopeless time to roam
The distance to your home
Fades away to nowhere
How much are you worth
You can't come down to earth
You?re swelling up, you're unstoppable
'cause you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

[E- A- D G/(D/F#) C C B B]
Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
'cause I?m drifting away
Away from you

Link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like it's a birth squeeze
And the love for what you hide
And the bitterness inside
Is growing like the new born
When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting their last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
?cause I'm drifting away
Away from you
