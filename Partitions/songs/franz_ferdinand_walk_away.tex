[D] ~ [A] ~ [B-] ~ [F#-]
I swapped my innocence for pride
Crushed the end within my stride
Said 'I'm strong now I know that I'm a leaver"
[D] ~ [A] ~ [B-] ~ [G]
I love the sound of you walking away
[D] ~ [A] ~ [G]
Mascara bleeds a blackened tear
[D] ~ [A] ~ [F#-]
And I am cold
Yes I'm cold
But not as cold as you are
[D] ~ [A] ~ [B-] ~ [G]
I love the sound of you walking away
I love the sound of you walking away, yeah [F#-]hey

[A]
Why don't you walk away?
Why don't you walk away?
[Bb] Why don't you walk away?
[D-] ~ [Bb]
No buildings will fall down
Why don't you walk away?
No quake will split the ground
Why don't you walk away?
[D-] ~ [G-]
The sun won't swallow the sky
Why don't you walk away?
Statues will not cry
[D-]
Why don't you walk away?
[A] Why don't you walk away?
[C] Why don't you walk away?
[G]Hey [A]

I cannot turn to see those eyes
As apologies may rise
I must be strong and stay an unbeliever
And love the sound of you walking away
Mascara bleeds into my eye
I'm not cold
I am old
At least as old as you are
As you walk away

And as you walk away
My headstone crumbles down
As you walk away
The Hollywood wind's a howl
As you walk away
The Kremlin's falling
As you walk away
Radio 4 is static
As you walk away

The stab of stiletto
On a silent night
Stalin smiles
Hitler laughs
Churchill claps
Mao Tse-Tung
On the back
