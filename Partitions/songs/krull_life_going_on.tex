[B-] ~ [F#-/A] ~ [E/G#] ~ [E-/G] ~
If I stay with you, if I'm choosing wrong
I don't care at all
If I'm losing now, but I'm winning late
That's all I want

Now we need some space, 'cause I feel for you
And I wanna change
Growing up alone, it seems so short
I can't explain

[B-] ~ [D] ~ [G] ~ [E-] ~
Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny
[B-] ~ [D] ~ [G] ~ [Asus4]~
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel


[E]  ~ [G] ~ [E] ~ [G] ~ [E] ~ [B-] ~[E] ~ [G6] ~ [A6] ~
I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on

I will be so strong, looking for a new version of myself
Cause now all I want is to be a part of my new world

Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel

I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Why not have it all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on
