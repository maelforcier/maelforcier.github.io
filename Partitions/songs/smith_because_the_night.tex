[B-] ~ [G] ~ [A] ~ [B-]

[B-]take me [G]now baby [A]here as I [B-]am
pull me [G]close, try and [A]unders[B-]tand
desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
love is a banquet on which we feed


[G]come on [A]now try and [D]unders[A]tand
the [B-]way I [G]feel when I'm in your [A]hands
[D]take my [G]hand come under [A]cover
they [C]can't hurt you now, [B-]can't hurt you now, [F#]can't hurt you now

[B-]because [G]the night belongs [A]to lo[B-]vers
because the night belongs to lust
because the night belongs to lovers
because the night belongs to us

have I doubt when I'm alone
love is a ring, the telephone
love is an angel disguised as lust
here in our bed until the morning comes
come on now try and understand
the way I feel under your command
take my hand as the sun descends

they can't touch you now,
can't touch you now, can't touch you now
because the night belongs to lovers ...

with [D]love [A]we sleep
with [D]doubt the [A]vicious circle turn [B-]and [A]burns
[D]without [A]you I cannot [B-]live
[A]for[D]give the [A]yearning burning
I be[G]lieve [D]it's time, [G]too real to feel
so [B-]touch me now, [D]touch me now, [G]touch me now [F#]

because the night belongs to lovers ..
because tonight there are two lovers
if we believe in the night we trust
because tonight there are two lovers ...
