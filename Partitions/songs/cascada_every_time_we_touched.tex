[E-]I still hear your [G]voice, when you [D]sleep next to [C]me.
[E-]I still feel your [G]touch in my [D]dreams.
[C]Forgive me [G]my weakness, but [D]I don't know [E-]why.
[C]Without you [G]it's hard [D]to survive.


Cause everytime we [C]touch, I [D]get this fe[E-]eling.
And everytime we [C]kiss I [Dsus4]swear I could [E-]fly.
Can't you feel my [C]heart beat [G]fast,
I [D]want this to[E-] last.
[G]Need you by my [D]side.
Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static.
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat slow.
I can't let you go.
I want you in my life.

Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky.
They wipe away tears that I cry.
The good and the bad times, we've been through them all.

You make me rise when I fall.


Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling.
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last.
I need you by my side.
Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static.
And everytime we kiss, I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat so.
I can't let you go.
I want you in my life.

Cause everytime we touch, I get this feeling.
And everytime we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast.
I want this to last.
I need you by my side.
