 Little black submarines
Operator please
Put me back on the line
Told my girl I'd be back
Operator please

This is wrecking my mind

Oh, can it be
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

Pick you up, let you down
When I wanna go
To a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans
But they just disappeared
To the back of my mind

Oh, can it be

The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

Treasure maps, falling trees
Operator please
Call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease
Operator please
Pass me back to my mind

Oh, can it be
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it go

But everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
