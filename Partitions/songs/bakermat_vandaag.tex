 We face the difficulties of today and tomorrow
I still have a dream
It is a dream in the American dream
I have a dream
One day

This nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal

I have a dream
That one day on the red hills of Georgia
The sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners
Will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
